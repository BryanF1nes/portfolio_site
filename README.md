# Portfolio Site

This is a portfolio site created using my custom webpack template.
Tech stack that was used is, Webpack, HTML, CSS, JS. I plan on revisting this to make the entire site using Javascript.

TODO: 
  - Update entire website using only JS
  - Finish form logic to actually send an email
  - Update a way to add more projects dynamically
